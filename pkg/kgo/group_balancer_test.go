// This simple test hits every branch of cooperative-sticky's adjustCooperative
// by:
//
//   1) having partitions migrating from one member to another
//   2) having a whole topic migrate from one member to another
//   3) adding new partitions in the plan (new topic wanted for consuming, or an eager member)
//   4) completely deleting partitions from the plan (topic no longer wanted for consuming)
//   5) having a member that is still on eager
//   6) having two members that think they own the same partitions (similar to KIP-341)
//
// Thus while it is an ugly test, it is effective.
